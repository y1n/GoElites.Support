Hello friends!

As you may know, yesterday we together with all other similar services on the scene were given a «*Christmas gift*» of a kind. We were not able to anticipate this and were surprised as everyone else. However, it allowed us to take a broader look at the functioning of our software.
We are working hard to push new update which will be out today or tomorrow. We are sorry for the losses caused by the recent event but please be sure that we're working hard and are doing our best to ensure that you're given a high-quality product.
Meanwhile, we are also happy to announce some of the upcoming changes:

 - **Zoe release is on the way**. Something that has been requested by many but had to be delayed due to the other items on our priority list.
 - **Improvement in forum stability and functionality**. We are going to make few more steps towards the intuitivity and optimization. 
 - **Fixes and improvements to our core and application**. We strive to allow you to enjoy the richest and stress-free experience.

Thanks for your support and keep in touch!
***GoElites Administration***
