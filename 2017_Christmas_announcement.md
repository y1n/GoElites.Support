Dear friends,

First of all we would love to thank all of you for staying with us during this holiday time. Despite the fact that we still have issues here and there, you guys have always been patient and understanding. Maintaining the integrity of our service has never been easy for us and while this is something that we're being reassured over and over again, we always feel relief in the fact that we have such wonderful people in the community that we are part of. 

Now during the period when we believe most of you guys enjoy your time with friends and family and prepare your gifts for those who are important to you, we want to give you a little gift too:
1. **3 days of subscription for everyone** who has signed up before 28.12.2017 23:59 GMT+1. 
2. **5 extra days of subscription for Subscribers**, which will be added on top of the 3 days from above at 29.12.2017 00:00 GMT+1.

Also there is one more change which may seem controversial for some of you guys but we believe that we're making a step in right direction. We are happy to announce that our community is going to be open for everyone willing to join. We have already grown big and solid enough to set new higher standards and repeal ones which are no longer effective. While it may seem wrong and risky at first glance, it may be an essential step for us in a long run. 

GoElites improves every day. We learn new lessons and grow stronger with each obstacle we leave behind. But it would never be possible without you guys as you are the force that pushes us forward and makes us wake up to bring something new. Thank you once more for being with us and for the unity that has gathered all of us here together. 

**Merry Christmas**!
