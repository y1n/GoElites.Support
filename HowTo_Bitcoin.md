This thread is meant to get you aquainted with the basics of bitcoin and help you aquire the subscription using **your own bitcoin wallet** with adjustable transaction fees, which means that you won't have anyone in the middle of your transactions (*nobody to delay your payment*) and will allow you to save money (*you can adjust your own fee depending on how urgent you need the payment to be processed*). 
Current tutorial is divided into following steps:

- Setting up your bitcoin wallet 
- Buying bitcoins via LocalBitcoins.com

**Setting up your bitcoin wallet** (*if you decide to use services which don't provide a wallet upon registration*)

While there are for sure a number of free wallets available in the internet which vary in the number of features and ways you can personalize your bitcoin wallet, I assume this guide will mostly be read by those who are new to whole bitcoin thing and want a quick and relatively easy way to obtain a subscription. For this purpose we will be using a free web bitcoin wallet provided by https://blockchain.info/. This service is proven to be extremely safe and reliable if you look for a wallet to receive and spend small amount of bitcoins here and there (*which is what we are going to do*).
1. Go to the https://blockchain.info/ website and click "**Get a free wallet**.

2. Enter your credentials and click "**Continue**". You will use an ID generated automatically and sent to your email in order to login. Your email address will only be used as a confirmation measure when trying to make changes to your account or trying to access the wallet from unusual location.

 5. When using currency exchange services to buy bitcoins, just paste your bitcoin address as a recipient and you'll receive your bitcoins directly on your wallet avoiding third-party services which force you to use wallets linked to their system.

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**:
1. Keep in mind that you need to buy a little bit more bitcoins in order to be able to pay the transaction fee. Payments with low or no transaction fee will take additional time to process (*they may take 12 hours or more*). Fees are usually calculated in **satoshis per byte**, approximate time of transaction confirmation depending on the fee can be checked on https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/. This is not something you have to really care about if you don't care about spending an extra dollar though.
2. **ALWAYS** make sure that you've sent an exact amount of money our system requires you to send. If you send less - you will not be given a subscription, your transaction request will eventually run out (*remaining time is shown on checkout page*) and you will simply waste money as a result, if you send more - it will serve as a donation.
