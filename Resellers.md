Hello everyone!

As you know, we're currently only accepting Bitcoin as the way to buy the subscription. While we understand that for many of you this method is very far from convenient, it will remain the only payment we officially accept for a longer period of time. In the meanwhile, in order to lift the burden of having to get aquainted with bitcoin, we're allowing resellers to do the job for you. 
While many of you may have already been successfully using such services to obtain GoElites subscriptions, we have been receiving too many scam and rip-off reports for us to decide to take the situation under our control. What does it all mean:

**For customers**: our forum will serve as the filter to separate scammers from resellers. Those who are allowed to post in the corresponding section of our forum are way more trusted then many of those who remain in the shade. We will not enforce discriminative measures and will allow every trustworthy reseller to open their service on our forum, it means that you'll get lower prices due to the constant competition.

**For resellers**: if you are trusted person in our community and have an ability to make profits from reselling our software subscriptions - we will give you tools to expose your service to the wider audience. The better your service is - the more profit you gain, leaving both you and our customers satisfied.

As the administration, we'll do our best to prevent any fraudlent activity from being conducted in our community. If you have been scammed or experience any other issues with the resellers - please contact Moderators.
