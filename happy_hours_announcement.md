Happy winter holidays friends!

Today we are going to announce that we are ready to implement some features you have been asking for. Although the introduction of the paid model was a necessity, it made getting aquainted with our product problematic for newcomers. We clearly acknowledge that everyone wants to try something before buying it, and honestly we were slacking with the implementation of such policy. But we are going catch up on this with two upcoming updates.

### Happy hours

We will allow everyone to use GoElites for free within three time windows per day.
- 7:00 - 8:00 UTC
- 15:00 - 16:00 UTC
- 23:00 - 24:00 UTC

Within these timeframes free members will be able to use the application as if they were subscribers. This will allow people who consider to join us to try our product first and then decide if they're still willing to subscribe.

### One week subscription

Within a week, we will add an option to buy 1 week subscription.  This one is highly requested and we are sorry not to have added it already. Hopefully, it will help you guys save some money and still enjoy GoElites when you have free time.

The price for one week subscription will be announced later. However, for the sake of saving your money, this subscription will only be able to be bought from [Resellers](https://goelites.net/index.php?/forum/68-resellers/) as Bitcoin fee is right now too high for small transactions.


We have got more changes on the way which we will announce as soon as we have made enough progress. As for now that's it, stay tuned for further updates!
