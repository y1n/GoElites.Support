Hello friends!

As you may have noticed, there haven't been any major news or announcements recently. Please don't consider it as a drop of our activity, because recently we have been working even harder than usual to make GoElites worth your time and resources. We're making improvements here and there, but the main focus is always the software. And while we have allocated so much effort to provide the best gaming experience, we have slightly missed out on some other aspects, especially the promotion. 

So today we will start to catch up by announcing a cool contest. We've come to the conclusion that we lack video materials to showcase the performance of our software. It wouldn't be fun to put it together by ourselves, so we'd rather give you an opportunity to show how good you are at both video editing and game itself. And of course, you can expect to collect some freebies along the way. 

So, what we would love to see from you is a **quality GoElites promotion video**. We do not restrict your imagination, so it may include crazy *plays*, *kills*, *moves* and basically anything else which would show one's gameplay performance with GoElites. 

And as we have mentioned, we have prepared some rewards for best entries:

 - **1st place**: 70$ + 2 months GoElites Subscription.
 - **2nd place**: 35$ + 1 month GoElites Subscription.
 - **3rd place**: 1 month GoElites Subscription.

Winners will be chosen from the most popular entries, so please, if you're skilled in video editing or just want to try yourself - don't hesitate and try your luck.

For those who are not interested in submitting own entries for some reason - we would love you to still make a contribution by leaving a feedback, telling us which entry seems the best for you. Also, expect more new features and champions soon, so please stay in touch!
